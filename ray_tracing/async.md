## Directions:
Find an article about ray tracing and post your thoughts on async slack channel.

## Response:
This isn’t an article per se, but would be a really helpful tool--I think--for introducing ray tracing in a classroom. Produced by Disney (as part of a behind-the-scenes set of videos about animation techniques), the video explains--in the style of an old cartoon--how path tracing works in animated films. It’s so educational! And would be really good as a tie-in to a project in class where you use path tracing to illuminate one still image:
