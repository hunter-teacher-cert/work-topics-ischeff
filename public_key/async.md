## Encryption Async:

The [Jefferson Disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_disk) was apparently a form of encryption proposed by Thomas Jefferson. (It was also independently invented by a Frenchman named Etienne Bazeries.)

The cipher is a cylinder of plaintext characters, made of multiple disks, which can be spun around to create a message in regular text. Then the user chooses another row that is offset from the intended text and copies that seemingly gobbledegook down.

The “key” in this instance is the order of the cylinders, which would have to be shared between the person encrypting the message and the person decrypting it, and the number of rows by which the message is offset from the encrypted text. (Although I assume you could also guess that once you had the message lined up.)

Nowadays, this would be trivial for a computer to untangle--if you have 10 disks, there are 10! ways to arrange them, or about 3.5 million. But, back then, this would have been quite strong--who wants to check 3.5 million different possible arrangements of the disks by hand?

Apparently, this was also used (at least to some extent) in WWII!

## Comment on Lyuba's post, on Quantum Cryptography:

This is super interesting! I thought about writing up this one, too. What I find interesting is that it relies on fundamental physical properties that seemingly can’t be “hacked”, such as the fact that light is a wave and a particle. What I wonder is how you would actually set this up--it seems you’d need a fiber optic cable to send the message and a beamsplitter to receive it, and I assume these are not as easy to get ahold of as an internet connection and a computer.
