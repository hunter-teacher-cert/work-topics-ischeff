*** Update: 1/23/22
- Drafted an EXTREMELY simple sentence generator
- This one is very basic, in that text is already pre-broken into parts of speech
- The program randomly selects a part of speech and concatenates it with others
- There's no ML-predicability of what comes next in the sentence
- We'll try creating/adding more ML-infused models (a chatbot?) 
- This might serve as a "basic" or "starter" example!
